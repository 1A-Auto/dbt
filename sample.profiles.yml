# create a second profile. You can switch to this profile in the CLI with --profile my-org
# Valid dbt options include:
# dbt debug --profile my-org # use my-org profile with default "dev" run target
# dbt debug --profile my-org --target dev # explicitly use "dev" run target
# dbt debug --profile my-org --target prod # switch to the "prod" run target
# these flags work with `dbt (debug|compile|run|test)` as you would expect!
