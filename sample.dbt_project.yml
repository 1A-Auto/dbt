      materialized: true  # create a table instead of a view

      # You can choose sort keys, a dist key, or both to improve query efficiency. By default, materialized
      # tables are created with no sort or dist keys.
      #
      sort: ['@timestamp', '@userid'] # optionally set one or more sort keys on the materialized table
      dist: '@userid'                 # optionally set a distribution key on the materialized table

    pardot_visitoractivity:
      materialized: false
      sort: ['@timestamp']  # this has no effect, as sort and dist keys only apply to materialized tables

# add dependencies. these will get pulled during the `dbt deps` process.
