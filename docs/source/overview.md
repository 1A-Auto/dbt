# dbt overview #

### What is dbt? ###
dbt [data build tool] is a tool for creating analytical data models. dbt facilitates an analytical workflow that closely mirrors software development, including source control, testing, and deployment. dbt makes it possible to produce reliable, modular analytic code as an individual or in teams.

### Who should use dbt? ###
dbt is built for data consumers who want to model data in SQL to support production analytics use cases. Familiarity with tools like text editors, git, and the command line is helpfulâ€”while you do not need to be an expert with any of these tools, some basic familiarity is important.

### Why do I need to model my data? ###
With the advent of MPP analytic databases like Amazon Redshift and Google BigQuery, it is now common for companies to load and analyze large amounts of raw data in SQL-based environments. Raw data is often not suited for direct analysis and needs to be restructured first. Some common use cases include:
- sessionizing raw web clickstream data
- amortizing multi-month financial transactions

### What exactly is a "data model" in this context? ###
A dbt data model is a SQL `SELECT` statement with templating and dbt-specific extensions.

### How does dbt work? ###

dbt has a small number of core functions. It:
- takes a set of data models and compiles them into raw SQL,
- materializes them into your database as views and tables, and
- runs automated tests on top of them to ensure their integrity.

Once your data models have been materialized into your database, you can write analytic queries on top of them in any SQL-enabled tool.

Conceptually, this is very simple. Practically, dbt solves some big headaches in exactly *how* it accomplishes these tasks:
- dbt interpolates schema and table names in your data models. This allows you to do things like deploy models to test and production environments seamlessly.
- dbt automatically infers a directed acyclic graph of the dependencies between your data models and uses this graph to manage the deployment to your schema. This graph is powerful, and allows for features like partial deployment and safe multi-threading.
- dbt's opinionated design lets you focus on writing your business logic instead of writing configuration boilerplate code.

### What databases does dbt currently support? ###
Currently, dbt supports PostgreSQL and Amazon Redshift. We anticipate building support for additional databases in the future.
