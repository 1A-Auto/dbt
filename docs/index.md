# Welcome to the dbt docs!

dbt [data build tool] is a tool for creating analytical data models. dbt facilitates an analytical workflow that closely mirrors software development, including source control, testing, and deployment. dbt makes it possible to produce reliable, modular analytic code as an individual or in teams.

For more information on the thinking that led to dbt, see this article: https://medium.com/analyst-collective/building-a-mature-analytics-workflow-the-analyst-collective-viewpoint-7653473ef05b

These docs provide information on getting started, using, and contributing to dbt.
