# Welcome to the dbt docs!

dbt [data build tool] is a tool that makes it possible to produce reliable, modular analytic code as an individual or in teams using a workflow that closely mirrors software development. For more information on the thinking that led to dbt, see [this article](https://medium.com/analyst-collective/building-a-mature-analytics-workflow-the-analyst-collective-viewpoint-7653473ef05b).

These docs provide information on getting started, using, and contributing to dbt.
